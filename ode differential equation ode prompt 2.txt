nh3 molecule give an ode simultaneous eqaution differential eqaution on  based newtons motion cpnsidering mass

give as mH(d^2v1/dt^2)=kHH(v1-v2)+kHH(v1-v3)+kNH(v1-v4) where v is a vector v(t) to find solution give in this form

like this give for v1,v2,v3,v4 vector as simultaneous ode

give for mh*d^2v2,/dt^2,mh*d^2*v3/dt^2,mn*d^2*v4/dtz^2 give for v1,v2,v3 v4 vectors as simultaneous ode



v1,v2,v3,v4 are vectors
