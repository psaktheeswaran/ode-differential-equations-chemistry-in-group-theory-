nh3 molecule give an ode simultaneous eqaution differential eqaution on  based newtons motion cpnsidering mass

give as mH(d^2v1/dt^2)=kHH(v1-v2)+kHH(v1-v3)+kNH(v1-v4) where v is a vector v(t) to find solution give in this form

no like ths m

give for mh*d^2v2,/dt^2,mh*d^2*v3/dt^2,mn*d^2*v4/dtz^2 give for v1,v2,v3 v4 vectors as simultaneous ode


convert to eigen value form 



can you derive the above to chemical group theory notion and then to wave function form 

ok the derive

for nh3 molecule in x,y,z v1,v2,v3,v4 as vector functions then derive to eigen value from the ode you create annd the to wave function

ok then to scrodinger equation form



no v1,v,v3,v4 as vector function in x,y,z in 3d

no v1(t),v2(t),v3(t),v4(t) nad to eigen value form then to wave function then to scrondinger eqaution

0 connect this with Connection to Schrödinger Equation:
The connection to the Schrödinger equation involves further steps and assumptions, including the use of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and the treatment of nuclear motion within the electronic potential energy surface. The potential energy surface derived from the classical force constants may be used to formulate an approximate potential energy term in the Schrödinger equation.

The vibrational wave function

Ψ(r) for NH₃ can be expressed as a product of the vibrational wave functions along each coordinate axis:

This is an approximate treatment, and the actual derivation and solution would require more detailed analysis, including the electronic structure of NH₃.


ok derive it


i said for nh3 as vector functions v1(t),v2(t),v3(t),v4(t) form


ok then to scrondinger equation fit the above and find solution


yes do it
